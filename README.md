# Usage/Features

This application allows users to create a profile when they sign up. A user’s complete profile includes details such as their preferred court location and weekly availability.

Once the profile is fully completed, users gain full access to the application’s features. One key feature is the player search, which enables users to find nearby players. The application displays a list of players, their distance, and availability. Additionally, users can chat directly with players they find.

To make finding courts easier, the application also offers a court search feature, complete with an interactive map to locate nearby tennis courts.
