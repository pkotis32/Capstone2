| Tech Stack | What tech stack will you use for your final project?                          | Node, React, Express, PostgreSQL      |
| Type       | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Website |
| Goal       | What goal will your project be designed to achieve?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The goal of this project is to create an application that will allow users to search for other nearby tennis players, with the ability to message them and hopefully meet up to be able to play with each other. The application will have features that will allow users to view others' profiles as well as an interactive map to see where the other players are located and the tennis courts near the area.     |
| Users      | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The demographic for this application will be focused for specifically all tennis players regardless the skill level. The application should be able to show each player's skill level, so that a user can search for players near the skill level they would like to play against.        |
| Data       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. | I plan on using a google maps api that will allow for a live rendering of google maps on the application. Some data I would like to collect is the user's information to populate their profile as well as maybe a preferred tennis court that they play at, so that the google maps will be able to render those preferred courts for each player for others to see.           |

# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later. Some common tasks might include:

- Determining the database schema
- Sourcing your data
- Determining user flow(s)
- Setting up the backend and database
- Setting up the frontend
- What functionality will your app include?
  - User login and sign up
  - Uploading a user profile picture

Here are a few examples to get you started with. During the proposal stage, you just need to create the tasks. Description and details can be edited at a later time. In addition, more tasks can be added in at a later time.

| Task Name                   | Description                                                                                                   | Example                                                           | Actual |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Design Database schema      | Determine the models and database schema required for your project.                                           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/1) | [
| Source Your Data            | Determine where your data will come from. You may choose to use an existing API or create your own.           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/2) | [Api Link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/embedding-map)
| User Flows                  | Determine user flow(s) - think about what you want a userâ€™s experience to be like as they navigate your site. | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/3) | 
| Set up backend and database | Configure the environmental variables on your framework of choice for development and set up database.        | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/4) | 
| Set up frontend             | Set up frontend framework of choice and link it to the backend with a simple API call for example.            | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/5) | 
| User Authentication         | Fullstack feature - ability to authenticate (login and sign up) as a user                                     | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/6) |
